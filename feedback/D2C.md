## Group Feedback

- Congratulations on completing all the tasks for Part 1! I can see a lot of effort has gone into your implementation, and the code is well-structured and easy to understand.
- I'm happy to see my feedback for D2B was used to improve the design.
- I really like the way the well-formedness checks and conversions to/from String representations are decomposed between the relevant classes in the `playerState` and `sharedState` packages.
- Methods are well named and documented. You could make better use of class Javadocs to provide an overview of the purpose and key behaviours of important classes.
- Why is the method `PlayerState.getAllPlayerStates()` not used? It looks like it could be used to simplify `Azul.getBonusPoints()` and `Azul.nextRound()`.
