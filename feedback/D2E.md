## Group Integration Feedback
* The Game class is only a skeleton, but it runs OK. You need to work together as a group to design the Game GUI. I suggest you test your design with a user who is not a member of your group (e.g. family member) to observe how they interact with your game and any confusion they have.

# Code Review Feedback

### Mark: **0.5/1**

#### Criteria for gaining 0.5 / 1
* Your originality statement has been edited, committed and pushed,
  passing the CI compliance test. **yes**
* You have reviewed another group member’s contribution, and the
  review file has been committed and pushed. **yes**
  
#### Criteria for gaining 1 / 1
* Your review comments are appropriate and actionable. **no**

### Comments: 
* This is a very good description of Jiawen's code, particularly what is good about it. However, the review is not actionable - there is nothing that Jiawen can use to improve her work. Could the code be simplified by the addition of another class? Even small improvements are worth noting e.g. duplicated code at lines 403 and 407.

### Comments: 
* As per comments above, the review is a good description of what is good about Yuhui's code, but it's not actionable. How could it be improved, e.g. why is the method parameter gameState[0] updated partway through the method?

### Comments: 
* Again, this review is not actionable; there is nothing Qinling can use to improve the code. For example, should the discard string be checked using `Discard.isWellFormed` rather than `Bag.isWellFormed`? Should both these methods be combined on a superclass?
